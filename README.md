# Real-Time-Object-Detection
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect various objects in images and videos with high accuracy and speed.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Perform object detection in real-time on video streams.
- **Multiple Object Detection**: Identify and classify multiple objects within a single frame.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes the YOLO algorithm to achieve high detection accuracy.
- **Customizable**: Easily configurable to detect different classes of objects.
  ## Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

The YOLO algorithm was developed by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi.
This project is inspired by various open-source object detection projects and tutorials.
